# E-commerce-website
This project is a simple e-commerce landing page built with HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript. It is intended purely for practice purposes to improve my front-end development skills.

The design for this project was sourced from Figma, where you can find the original layout and visual guidelines for the UI. The goal was to replicate the look and feel of the provided design as closely as possible using only vanilla web technologies (no frameworks or libraries).

I'd love to hear your feedback on the code! If you have any suggestions or improvements, please feel free to check it out and let me know your thoughts.
